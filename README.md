Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset indicates that a few microbial species, alternatively referred to as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within the study, were detected in over 70% of individuals, while the remainder were relatively infrequent.
The site has the following elements:

A test subject drop-down menu that is dynamically populated based upon the sample data
A panel and three graphs are dynamically created based upon the subject selected:
A Demographic Panel that lists the subject's information
A Bar Graph that illustrates the ten most prevalent OTU's found for this subject
A Bubble Graph that illustrates the OTUs and their relative sample values
A Gauge that shows the washing frequency
